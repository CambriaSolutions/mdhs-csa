The JSON files in this folder are auto generated by running "generateCoordinates.js".
Do NOT make changes to these files directly!!

CoordinatesSet1 and CoordinatesSet2 represent the coordinates for the different offices in Mississippi. 
They are divided into sets because some are shared among the different subject matter.

At the time of writing this comment, coordinatesSet1.json holds the office locations for CSE 
while coordinatesSet2.json holds the office locations for TANF, SNAP, and WFD (All three share the same locations)
