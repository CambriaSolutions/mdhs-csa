The online shopping and payment option is required to be secure, private, easy to use, and provide similar support to that found for SNAP transactions in a retail store. Not all FNS approved retailers are authorized to accept EBT online. The only retailers currently authorized are Amazon, ALDI and Walmart. The best way to determine if grocery delivery is available for your location is to visit the retailer websites."
